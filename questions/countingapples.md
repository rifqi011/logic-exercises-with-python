## Apple Counting Challenge

**Story:**
A farmer has an apple orchard. He wants to know how many apples he has in total. He's written down the number of apples from each tree in a list. Some trees might not have any apples, so there might be zeros in the list. Your job is to help the farmer count all the apples.

**Your Task:**
Write a Python function called `count_apples(trees)` that:
* Takes a list of numbers (representing the apples on each tree).
* Adds up all the numbers in the list.
* Returns the total number of apples.

**Example:**
```python
# Example 1
trees = [2, 3, 0, 4]
print(count_apples(trees))  # Output: 9

# Example 2
trees = [0, 0, 0]
print(count_apples(trees))  # Output: 0

# Example 3
trees = [5]
print(count_apples(trees))  # Output: 5
```

**Rules:**
1. Your code should work even if the list is empty (return 0).
2. There will be no negative numbers in the list.

**Explanation of the Markdown:**
* **Headers:** `#` is used for headings, making the text bold and larger.
* **Code Blocks:** Triple backticks (```) are used to denote code blocks, which are essential for showing Python code examples.
* **Lists:** Unordered lists (like the rules) are created using asterisks (*).
* **Emphasis:** You can use asterisks (*) or underscores (_) to italicize words or phrases.
